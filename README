The summation problem, which is extended from the classical a-plus-b problem, is a programming challenge for beginners. It asks a programmer to read many integers separated by whitespace in one line and then write out their sum. Although simple, different solutions to this problem can exhibit the characteristics of various programming languages. For your information, the compiler (or interpreter) I used for each language and its version are listed below:

* Pascal: fpc 3.0.4
* C: clang 9.0.0
* C++: clang++ 9.0.0
* Python: python 3.7.5
* Ruby: ruby 2.6.5
* Shell: bash 3.2.57
* Objective-C 2.0: clang (-ObjC -fmodules)
* Swift: swift 5.1.2
* JavaScript (ES6+): node 12.12.0
* Smalltalk: gst 3.2.5
* Erlang: escript 22.1.5
* Elixir: elixir 1.9.2
