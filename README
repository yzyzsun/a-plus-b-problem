The summation problem, extended from the classical a-plus-b problem, is a
programming challenge for beginners. A programmer is asked to write a program to
read multiple integers separated by whitespace from a single line and then print
out their sum. Although not difficult, different solutions to this problem can
exhibit the characteristics of different programming languages. For your
information, the compiler (or interpreter) I used for each language and its
version are listed below:

* Pascal: fpc 3.0.4
* C: clang 9.0.0
* C++: clang++ 9.0.0
* Python: python 3.7.5
* Ruby: ruby 2.6.5
* Shell: bash 3.2.57
* Objective-C 2.0: clang (-ObjC -fmodules)
* Swift: swift 5.1.2
* JavaScript (ES6+): node 12.12.0
* Smalltalk: gst 3.2.5
* Erlang: escript 22.1.5
* Elixir: elixir 1.9.2
* Java: java 13.0.1
* C#: dotnet 3.0.100
* Scheme (R6RS): chez 9.5.2
* Common Lisp: sbcl 1.5.7
* Standard ML: smlnj 110.94
* OCaml: ocaml 4.08.1
* F#: dotnet 3.0.100
* Haskell: ghc 8.8.1
* Clojure: clj 1.10.1.510
